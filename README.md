Whispering serves as a form of communication in situations where speaking loudly is not practical in everyday life. It is produced by a sound source involving turbulent airflow passing through the vocal cords without vibration. There has been an examination of transforming whispered speech into standard speech. The objective is to assist individuals with damaged vocal cords in communicating using their own voice, eliminating the necessity for medical equipment like an electric artificial larynx. 

Here, the corpus of whispered speech includes normal speech dataset and whispered speech dataset that is created by formant shifting of normal speech and fundamental frequency removal of normal speech (https://www.lintech.org/).  The normal speech dataset is created from TIMIT corpus. It has 4671 utterances and each 15 seconds utterance.
